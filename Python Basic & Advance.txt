first install python 


1. data types .


	int -- a = 10 (auto find for python this is int )

	flat -- b = 0.4 (auto find in python )

	string -- c = " this is new word " ( " " is a string mention )


2. data type change .

	
	a = "10"
	b = "20"
	c = a + b

	print (c)  output: 1020 (" " is meaning for string )

	--- solution ---
	
	a = int ("10")
	b = int ("20")
	c = a + b
		
	print (c)  output: 30 ( int using inside off all numbers and don't allow letters)


3. if else concept .


	if - is condition
	
	else - is unsatisfied if condition it will be work

	a = 10
	if (a=10):
		print(" this number is ten ")
	else:
		print(" this number is not ten ") 

4. what's reminder .
	

	15 % 3 is a 0.
		
		ex: 15/3 is 5*3 =15 reminder is a 0.

	14 % 3 is a 2.

		ex: 15/3 is 4*3 =12 reminder is a 2.

		
	EX:	a=15
		if (a % 3 ==0):
			print(" this number division by 3")
		else:
			print(" this number not division by 3 ")


5.nested if .


	nested if is all condition check and will end the program


	mark=35

	if (mark<35):

		print("fail)

	if (mark>=35) & (mark<=70):

		print("pass")

	if (mark>70) & (mark<=100):

		print("excellent")


6.elif concept.



	elif is a when condition will be a true exit the program
	
		

	mark=65

	if (mark<35):

		print("fail)

	elif (mark>=35) & (mark<=70):

		print("pass")

	elif (mark>70) & (mark<=100):

		print("excellent")


	
	output= "pass"  my program will be second elif finished and exit 



7.for loop .


	for loop is list loop

	
	EX: for i in range(1,10):
		
		print(i)


	EX: count=0

		for x in range(1,10):
		
			if(x%2==0):
		
				count=count+1
		print(x)

		---- out put === 4



8.while loop .



		
		while loop is a unknown the end loop will run , 
		if your error infinity loop .



		a=1

		while (a>10):
			print(a)
			a= a+1


		output  :  1 to 9

		

		2. factorial
		
		a=3

		fact=1

		while (a>0):
			fact=fact*a
			a= a-1

		print(fact)




9. list , tuple , set , dictionary .




		list .
	
			1. []  this simple using , it's allow  all type of data

			2. mutable , change and modifying 

			3. it allow for duplicate [1,1,1,2]

		tuple .

			1. ()  this simple using , it's allow all data type

			2. immutable , we can't change and modifying 

			3. it allow for duplicate (1,1,1,2) 

		set .

			1. {}  this simple using , it's allow all data type's

			2. we can't change  and modifying , you can update

			3. it's don't allow for duplicate
 		

		Dictionary .

			1. {"name ": "prasanth} this simple using and this type 

			2. modifying the data

			3. don't allow duplicate's

			4. allow all data type's
	




10. function .


		This function using for a all high level program

		

		dif list(a,b):

			for x in range (a,b):

				print(x,end=" ")
		list(1,10)



		return -------

	
			one function inside any value and data here that value is 

			a return to main function called to return function.


			
			u="hacker"

			p="0101"

			u_name=input("enter username  : ")

			password=input("enter password : ")

			def login ():
		
				if u==u_name and p==password :
					
					return "correct"

				else:
		
					return "incorrect"

			print(login())
